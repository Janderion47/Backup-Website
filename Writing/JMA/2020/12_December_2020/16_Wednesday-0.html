<h1 class="western">Addiction to the Internet?</h1>
<p>What was the original purpose of the internet? Well at first, it
was used by the military so they could send commands and information
quickly. Then later on, scientists used it to move information and
data, and converse on it. In the present day, anyone can use the
internet to communicate, send photographs, watch videos, watch for
entertainment, read the news. Online News sources are not much
different than their physical world counterparts, journalists are
just as biased online as they are in a physical newspaper. Musicians
can much more easily spread their music, and gain traction in the
vast field of music lovers. Social Media platforms permit, well,
media, to be spread around much more easily; your cool aunt from your
mother’s side can now easily send you what is bascially a greeting
card in an email. The internet was created to make the transfering of
information much faster.</p>
<p>I think one of the easier topics to bring up related to this is
the rise of an addiction to things related to the internet, lets say
more specifically, an addiction to one’s phone. To understand why
this would exist, we first have to know how the addiction starts in
the first place. Now I have not done any scientific reseach, or have
attempted to look online for any, but considering what I have seen of
people my age, and what I have observed on the internet itself in
this present day. I think I have a good idea of why people have an
addiction to the internet.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Its important that we have a definition for addiction; an
addiction is, as according to Oxford Languages, is “the fact or
condition of being addicted to a particular substance, thing, or
activity.”, which is uses the word within the definition, so…
addicted, as according to Oxford Languages, is being “physically
and mentally dependent on a particular substance, and unable to stop
taking it without incurring adverse effects.” which seems to be in
reference to substance or drug addiction which is probably much worse
than any internet addiction, but we can see that addiction is a great
dependence on something external to one’s self.</p>
<p>People want to be constantly connected to others online, so what
motivation lies beneath this desire? I know that I have used the
internet more in this time of social distancing and quarantine than
before, and I have recognized this as a loneliness, from being
detached from my friends and peers, an attempt to keep the bonds
between each other from breaking or deteriorating over time. I was
about to say that I do not believe that I have an addiction to the
internet at the end of the previous sentence, but I know that between
06:10 and 06:50 every morning before school, I am watching a video on
Youtube to entertain myself as I make my daily cup of coffee. I know
my purpose of watching the videos is to be entertained, but does it
that mean it is an addiction to the internet? If there were other
options for entertainment in my daily routine, I do not know whether
I would or would not choose them, as when I find a video in the
morning I always have some preference; this feels similar to the
following situation:</p>
<blockquote>If I have a favorite musical band, for example,
“Sungazer”, a band of Bassist Adam Neely, and Drummer Shawn
Crowder, and I listen to them all the time, that would suggest that I
have an addiction to their music; the fact that I use the music
streaming service “Spotify” to listen to them does not mean I
have an addiction to the service, as I could easily listen to
Sungazer on Youtube, or Apple music, or Amazon Prime’s Music.<br/>
Or
as another example, if you like the work of a specific author of
books, you might read a lot of their work. One person may look at you
and assume you have a addiction of books, but in reality, you do not,
you love the work of a specific author.</blockquote>
<p>I do not think that people have addictions to the internet itself,
but to the content that is present on the platform. I know that one
of my fellow students of philosophy has recognized that they have
this large tendency of picking up their phone every morning after
waking up, that means that this specific peer of mine has something
on their phone that is something they are addicted to.</p>
<p>Also, is it an addiction to something if you have no other option
than to use it? Not many retail stores sell vinyl record or casette
tape players anymore, so does a person have an addiction to the use
of online music services? One would have to be identified as
listenting to music a lot, but sure you could say that this person
has an addiction to listening to music, otherwise they would likely
just like some music, but it does not seem that the repeated use of
an online music source is a sufficient condition for having an
addiction to online music services.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>On a different note, I have once heard that some psychologists
have done some research on people who seem to open their phone all
the time. If I remember correctly, they found that people who
regularly used social media, developed an anxiety about searching for
updates on their social media feed, and have to keep checking their
social media as to alleve that anxiety, which does not surprise me,
which is something to make note of.</p>
<h1 class="western">Corruption in Social Media Platforms</h1>
<p>It has been revealed in recent years that outside forces, and even
the leaders of the social media platforms have used their position to
influence the thoughts of the people that use their platforms. This
infringes on the people’s right to free thought. Regardless of the
purpose of this, this is bad.</p>
<p>How would one attempt to draw someone away from the poor influence
and stream of ideas presented on these social media platforms, as to
reveal to them what is true and what is not? I think this problem is
similar to the Allegory of the Cave, as we who are the ones who have
left the cave, will come back, but it is not garunteed that our
former fellow-prisoners will eventually leave the cave. We don’t
need to convince them of that the place that they are in is a prison,
we just need to teach them that there are other ways of thinking,
that is what bringing someone out of the prison is; when the former
prisoner looks back on the cave, they then know that the prison was a
prison. We need to lead people to be able to critique practically
anything, that is what the allegory says we should do.</p>
