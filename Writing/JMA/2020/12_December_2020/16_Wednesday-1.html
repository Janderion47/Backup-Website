<font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Good
Father?</font></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
I once watched a television episode which featured a scene where a
man was going to leave his wife and daughter to protest/fight to
promote for the increasing of government measures to combat climate
change. The man said that he would not return until he had ensured
that the world will be set on a track of improving the conditions, he
wanted to ensure that his daughter would be able to live in a world
where she does not have to worry about the climate of the world,
which I believe is a noble cause. What I want to question is if this
noble cause outweighs the daughter’s need for her father?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
The man, actually I do not want to keep saying that, lets call him
Joe; Joe certainly values his daughter as I specifically remember
that he wants her future to be as best as it can, but it seems that
he ignores her need for a father in her life, sort of valuing her
average comfort in life over her average comfort in life in the
shorter term, which if this is a math equation in the form of ‘a’
is greater than ‘b’, then I would agree in Joe’s decision to
maximize the value of ‘a’. I can understand this as parents want
the best for their childre; its like self sacrifice, I am sure that
there have been numerous scenarios depicted in movies and t.v. series
that show a parent sacrifising their own life for the survival of
their children; Joe, in not participating in his daugther’s
childhood, is practically dead in her life.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
Is Joe a good father in this case? Well, does valuing his daughter’s
future outweigh her need for a father in her life? We’re gonna need
a definition for “a good father” if we’re going to attack this
quesiton, as I have listened to a podcast where a group of friends
were playing the tabletop game <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i><span style="font-style: normal">,
which is a roleplay, improv game in which multiple people (known as
the players) roleplay specific characters (known as playable
characters or PCs) and one of the members of the game controls the
setting and plot of the story of the game as it goes on (known as the
Dungeon Master or DM), the DM also roleplays non-playable character
(NPCs). One of the recent episodes sees one of the PCs put on trial
on accusations of being a bad father, which creates much interesting
and funny discourse as the other PCs taking on the defense of their
accused friend, and a guest player roleplays the offending lawyer. In
roleplaying this court of law, the defending lawyers, began an
attempt to use philosophical thinking in creating a defense for their
friend, saying that, they acknowledge some of the legitimate claimes
of bad parenting from their friend, the defendant’s intentions in
trying to be a single father are good, and that the court of law
cannot put him in jail for having good intentions but bad execution.
The offending lawyer stated that it does not matter what the morals
say, what matters within their court of law is the word of the law
itself, questioning “by our law, has your friend broken our law?”.
By this time, the players and DM had paused for a moment in their
playing to acknowledge that the DM did not foresee the usage of
morality, and that he was sorry for not specifying how the accused’s
“goodness” would be judged. In the end, the accused was found
guilty of being a bad dad, and the players found that it would be a
magical embodiment of the law of the land that would eventually hand
out the punishment to the character.</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
<span style="font-style: normal">This episode of the podcast always
brings me back to the fact that it is difficult to objectively
determine what consitutes as being a good parent, as the “objective”
perspective of the law in that podcast did not take into account the
situationalness of events and incidents. Though, I think it would not
be hard to consider what would consitute a good parent in terms of
necessary and sufficient conditions; I think it would be harder to
determine sufficient conditions for being a good parent than
determining necessary conditions for the same as that suggest that
there must be one singular trait of a person that would label them as
a good parent. Even if we were to construct a list of necessary and
sufficient conditions, I doubt that all people who might be
considered good parents would be in accordance with all of the
necessary conditions. Would we even be able to answer the question
“Is Joe a good father in his decision to leave his family for the
benefit of his daughter?” if there is no objective “good father”
or “good parent”? If we cannot, then what is the significance of
the fact that we have no objective definition for either?</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
<span style="font-style: normal">I do not think that we would be able
to answer the question as having an understanding of what a good
father is necessary before we can compare Joe to the criteria. The
fact that we have no objective definition shows that perhaps the
concept of a good father is very much subjective, everyone can have
their own opinion, but there must be a singlular definition, there
must be.</span></p>

and Evil are Different?</font></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
<span style="font-style: normal">Thinking about this previous topic
reminds me of one other topic discussing the idea of good. I remember
the following ethical issue from the Marvel movie “Doctor Strange”,
of which one of the central characters of the story had been revealed
to use a form of magic considered to be evil, to power their good
intentions toward the world. This was revealed when this central
character had to face off with some actual forces of evil, who were
also using the evil form of magic. Now, I was about to argue that,
perhaps its not the magic that is evil, it is simply the people who
use it are usually evil, considering that this central character is
using it with good intentions, but for context, this magic comes from
the literal enemy of the central character, which makes the central
character a hypocrate as was called out by the one central evil
character.</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
<span style="font-style: normal">I will agree that this usage of the
by-definition, evil magic by the central character makes her a
hypocrate, as her entire school of magic was establish to protect the
world from outside forces such as the one which the evil magic comes
from, but does that make her a bad/evil person? That again needs a
solid, objective definition of good apart from evil.</span></p>
