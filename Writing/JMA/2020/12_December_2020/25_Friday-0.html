<body lang="en-US" link="#000080" vlink="#800000" dir="ltr"><p>I
wonder about the significance of the concept of love, the idea that
we would have deep care for another entity. I would like totalk
specifically on the idea of romantic, perhaps sexual love, between
one human being to another, as it seems to be one of the most
important parts of our human experience. I’ve been thinking about
the idea of love and how it would be connected to being human, and
one question that has sat in my mind is “when did humans begin to
love?”, well I think a more elaborate question is “what are the
necessary and sufficient conditions of being able to love?”</p>
<p>Is the ability to discern between one’s self and others be
necessary to be able to love? I think that the ability to discern
between self and other is necessary to say “I love you” as that
statement would be in recognition of one’s self and another, so I
would say that it would be necessary that one would be able to
discern between self and other, but this example also requires that
verbal language is also necessary. I think one other example that
would assist in understanding is a person and their pet dog. Lets
assume that this person greatly loves and adores their dog, but does
the dog reciprocate the same feeling? I know this diverges from the
idea of romantic love, but I think that in this case, the concept of
love fits in any way.</p>
<p>How can we question if a dog is able to love if we have not
established a definition of love? If one is to ask “What is love?”
in public, they would most likely be replied to with the lyrics of
the 1993 song “What is Love” by the band Haddaway. I think a
commonly accepted definition of love or being in love with another
would be that one who loves another would take extreme care of the
other, and would value the other above theirself; resulting in
valueing the other’s enjoyment above their own, or perhaps the one
sacrificing their own life for the other.</p>
