How would William Godwin view the current state of social media in The present day? I think the most strinking aspect of social media that Godwin would criticize is the platforms' ability to control the masses, as Godwin critiqued governments who were able to influence the people under them. Godwin beleived that all people were entitled to their own personal thought, that they should have the opportunity to think of everything for themself; the hand that controls the masses is infringing on this right that all peopel deserve.

If I were to build a social platform that Godwin would agree with, then there should be minimal affect from the controllers of said platform,
