I personally have a great respect for many public figures, I thought I might make a list to note them, to show y'all what public figures I respect.

Adam Neely: Musician, bassist, youtuber, member of the band named "Sungazer" of which they will release a new album, their third album, within the next few weeks.
Jacob Collier: One of the best musicians of our time, who embraces many unorthodox yet strangely beautiful new musical elelemnts which sometimes break with standard musical practices of our day.

These are just some of the people I look up to in this day, and there are many more, but I won't name them for sake of privacy as they are closer to me in the world.
