I have recently been going for a one hour long walk almost every single school day, and I have been carrying a walking stick, just incase I have to defend myself from one of my neighbors' dog. I have always told myself that I would enter combat with said dog if it came to it, and I do no doubt that I would harm the dog in an attempt to protect myself, but I am not one-hundred percent sure if it is the right thing to do.
Surely protecting oneself is sufficient in marking the action of harming said dog as morally acceptable, as morally good, but why is it like this?

The act of harming another is generally regarded as morally bad in most situations, but harming in an attempt to protext one's self is acceptable; this alludes to the fact that we value our own lives over the life of another who's currect status of living endangers us, and I would then be in the okay for harming the dog for attacking me as its status in being live is a threat to myself and I would have to incopacitate it to protect myself.

But what if we would have to harm another who has not committed or will not commit any attack against ourselves, but is still a threat to ourselves? For example, If you were subject to be put to death if you do not kill another entity such as a perfectly innocent animal. I would imagine most people would eventually commit to harming the innocent animal, but would have a great degree of guilt and have to face the reality that they have killed an innocent animal to protect themself.
