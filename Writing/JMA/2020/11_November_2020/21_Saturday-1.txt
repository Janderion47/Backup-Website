How many of you think that the redesigns of brands and companies look bad?
Yeah, I thought so.

If the designs are looking more simplisitc, then I would say that that is literal minimalism, like, artistic minimalism.
Minimalism is an art form which has arrisen in recent decades, and is very prevalent in many places.
