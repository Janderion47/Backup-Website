What is love?
No, seriously, what is love?

I think of love as an intelligent being's rationalization of the the impulse to mate. Now, I am thinking about monogamous relationships here, where two lifeforms mate for life.
Love seems to be a rationalization of the primal urges of "I am the alpha male, and I see the alpha female; I want to mate with her, but I do not want any competitors to get to her, so I am going to keep her away from the others."
It is the urge of wanting to stabilize one's position with their mate, so that they can reserve the best mate for themself.

What about when people say romantic things without using the word "love"?
It always sounds like "I want to be with you for eternity," or "We shall be together forever,"
Those examples play on the idea that we don't want others to have our mate.
