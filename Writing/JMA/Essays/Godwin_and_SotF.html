the Philosophy of William Godwin</font></p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; background: transparent; page-break-before: auto">
<font face="Piboto">Would Godwin support the idea of “Survival of
the Fittest” and the branching-off idea that only the strongest of
a group should live? Well, it does not seem very clear if Godwin
would or would not, but lets explore the topic as to see any place
where we could insert Godwin’s utilitariam philosophy into it.</font></p>
<h1 class="western">Context</h1>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; background: transparent">
<font face="Piboto">Survival of the Fittest (SotF) originally refered
to Charles Darwin’s discovery that only the best fitted of a group
would survive in an enviroment, those of the species who have the
most favorable traits in the enviroment, would have a higher chance
of survival than their peers who do not. William Godwin believed in
working towards a society of which all people would be capable of
thinking for themselves, critiquing all things, and generally
improving and progressing our society.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; background: transparent">
<font face="Piboto">I think, to better fit the philosophy of Godwin,
a better question to ask would be: would it make the general
happiness of the world greater if we permitted those who have the
least favorable traits to perish? Would it contribute to the
progression of our society, to create a policy of picking and
choosing the best fitting people to live, and let the others die, as
the ancient Spartans once did; permitting the elders of the city to
give sight to newborns, in order to judge if they were fit, if they
would survive; those that were deemed unworthy would be banished to
die in the local mountains, while the healthy ones would grow up, the
boys would train to be warriors, and the girls to learn the way of
the household (though I personally am not sure if the girls were
subject to the selection process that I am sure the boys went
through). This policy was enacted by a group of people, hundreds of
years ago, who were focused on their own warrior culture, focused on
choosing the best, the physically fittest of the lot as to benefit
their armies.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; background: transparent">
<font face="Piboto">Another example, the purging of those believed to
be unable to contribute to society in the country of Germany under
the administration of Adolf Hitler, as they believed that if you were
unable to contribute to society, then you do not deserve anything,
which I observed a relatively recently made television series which
explored an alternate timeline of which the Axis Powers won the
second world war, and much of the allied powers were violently
disrupted, and divided amongst the Axis Powers; in the show, it was
required that all doctors report to the government about the health
of their patients, and a doctor told a prominent military general
that his son seemed to have a medical condition that would infringe
on his status as a useful citizen, even offering the general some
sort of poisonous syringe, commenting something around the lines of
“If you don’t do it general, then they will, and we both know
that we don’t want that,”. The Nazis were known for their
utilitarian ideas,  100% usage of their populace, 0% unemployment
rate, which was achieved by the powerful central authority that was
Hitler, which included the purging of many in the holocaust, which
was murder nonetheless of those believed to be lesser than
pure-blooded germans. I would not disagree with the idea that many
Germans under the Nazi regime believed that their racial purging in a
belief that their blood made them superior was a stop forward for
their people in progressing to better the German Empire.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; background: transparent">
<font face="Piboto">SotF exists in the natural world, only the best
animals will survive and create offspring who would most likely have
the same favourable traits. On that note, I believe that Godwin would
only agree with this idea of physical SotF if it contributes to his
idea of improving or progressing our society.</font></p>
