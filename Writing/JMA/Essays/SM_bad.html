<font face="Piboto"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Consider,
for a moment, the significance of a politician promising benefits to
specific groups of supporters, it would not be unreasonabel to assume
that this politican would be elected into office if they promised the
most benefits to a majority of their population. If a politician was
truly the best option for the governemnt position, they would not
need to promise any benefits to become elected, but this
benefit-promising politician is using whatever needs of the people to
sway them to their side. A parallel could be drawn between this and
our social media platforms, of which many have started as innocent
platforms for conversing with one another, but it appears that thay
are now being used to sway the masses of our population.</font></font></p>

<font face="Piboto"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The fact
that democratically elected politicians have influence over the
people that would elect them does not seem to be a good element of
modern representational democracies. Had we not used this form of
democracy, we would likely be better engaged in debates with our
fellow citizens. Similarly, the existence of a body of people that
would have choice in determining what people would be subject to
viewing, would have great affect over others; this could be compared
to those that control social media platforms, and use them to
influence the content they see.</font></font></p>

<font face="Piboto"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">If I had
the opportunity to create a social media platform, that did not
interfere with peopleâ€™s thought processes, I would simply not
include any advertisements or any other content that the users did
not come to see. When I think back to the early implementation of
social media, I think back to a time when the platforms were just a
chill place for friends and family to converse over great distances;
but now, these platforms are capable of this, but now they connect
people to people that they do not even know.</font></font></p>

<font face="Piboto"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">If I built
a platform, I would design it so that you can only communicate with
those who you know, for example using special codes of which you
could give to someone as to permit them to communicate with yourself.
There would be no adds, there would be no public accounts, you would
only be permitted to speak with people you exchange codes with.</font></font></p>
