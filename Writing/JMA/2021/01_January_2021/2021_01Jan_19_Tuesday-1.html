<font face="Avenir Next"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Has
anyone ever considered what “love” is? I know that romantic love
is said to be the feeling of desire to be with another, and perhaps
have some physical intimacy between yourself and the other. I simply
think that the concept of love is our conscious mind trying to
interpret the biological urges to seek out a mate and create
offspring. </font></font><font face="Avenir Next"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
mean, why else would we be motivated by something outside of our
conscious power, to seek to be with another person of which we mate
for life as we want to ensure that our mate does not go to another
competitor? We even recognize physical and intellectual
characteristics of which we like and do not like about other people.</font></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; background: transparent">
<font face="Avenir Next"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">If it
is like this, then what is the meaning of “I love (in the romantic
sense) you.”? It would seem to say that in fulfilling the natural
urge to mate and create offspring, you have decided that the
recipient of the message has been selected because they have
favorable traits which you like and you are willing to work with them
as to create offspring.</font></font></p>

<font face="Avenir Next"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">It
feels strange to analyze this topic in this light, as it feels to
degrade some integral part of our human society. It is like
sandpaper, scraping at the romanticisms in our culture, such as of
men serenading the fair lady upon her balcony, though I suppose, this
idea of love that the previous few paragraphs has always been known
to all.</font></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; background: transparent">
<font face="Avenir Next"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Wait,
then what is the significance of people who do choose a mate, yet
wish to not procreate? I feel that this brings me back to my previous
thoughts of following a “natural” order, and that those who do
not follow the “natural” order are bad. By definition of survival
of the fittest, the desire to not procreate would then be an
unfavorable trait as you would then not be procreating, ending your
lineage.</font></font></p>

<font face="Avenir Next"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
have this somewhat intrusive thought in my mind now, but would a
person who is perfect in the use of logic, and is also biologically
capable of procreating, decide that they do not wish to have
children? This question is essentially asking what would be the
logical thing to do. </font></font><font face="Avenir Next"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
think once before, I have approached the natural order idea with the
idea that our ability to do logic and have a consciousness is to
support our lives, and let us think in more complicated terms of how
to fulfill our most basic needs of survival and our general
preservation of life.</font></font></p>
