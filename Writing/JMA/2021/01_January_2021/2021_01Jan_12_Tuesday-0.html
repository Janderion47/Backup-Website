<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><p class="western" align="left"><font color="#000000">Sort
of continuing from what I was writing yesterday, I realize that the
Graves’s model suggests that after our stage of rational thinking,
societies would delve into a form of communism. This sort of assumes
that after we have questioned everything in the world, we would
conclude that we would clearly find the philosophically good way of
life. It is as if everyone would be able to think for themselves in
rational thinking in the fifth level, that we would all work together
in thinking and deciding what is best to better our society in the
sixth level. That is what doing philosophy is, thinking about logical
connections between thoughts, reasonings, and conclusions as to
better something, usually one’s self or the world, which is the
middle grounds reasoning for doing philosophy isn’t it, doing
philosophy because we want to better ourselves.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" align="left">This is something that I am slightly
pressuring on a dear friend of mine, who has recognized that she has
a habit of calling herself stupid in typical conversation as a
recognition of an inability to recall information or quickly answer a
question. I have begun to guide her away from this habit in a late
night conversation between she and I last Wednesday evening. I asked
a few questions regarding this recognition of inability, and I wanted
to know what she has done to curb this problem that she has seen. She
said that she had not attempted to break this habit, so I had decided
that I would help her, saying that I would call her out every time I
think she used the word “stupid” or “dumb” inappropriately,
of which most of the inappropriate situations would be when she would
refer to herself in that manner impulsively. I have also told her of
some of the situations of which she does use the words, for example,
when it seems that she has to recall some piece of information and
had not given herself a sufficient length of time to think, should
would call herself stupid. One thing that I have been giving her is
somethings to say, rather than the “trigger” words that would
lead me to call her out such as “I’m not sure,” for when she is
unable to present some piece of information, and perhaps saying “I
don’t know,”</p>
<p class="western" align="left">I have also been presenting her with
the middle grounds reasoning for doing philosophy, that she should be
thinking about how to combat the issues she sees within herself, and
how to implement those plans, and that she should also review those
plans she has established and if they are working. I told her that
she should also consider what situations it would be appropriate to
say the things she would like to say, as it seem that she hasn’t
given much thought to these habits; I wanted to teach her to think
about these things herself, rather than coming to myself for direct
advice, as that is what Plato’s Allegory of the Cave (AotC)
presented? That we can only be fully open to explore the real world
if we are pulled into the real world, rather than being told what
path to take, as a blind follower such as a slave or just generally
unenlightened mind would think. I know that this previous statement
does not seem to be explained in the AotC, but it is an idea that I
have extrapolated from the AotC which feels to be true.</p>
<p class="western" align="left">It feels relevant to bring in
Godwin’s educational philosophy here as his proposed system of
teaching, of letting the student’s mind wander around in thought as
the teacher follows in observance, for example how my IB Philosophy
teacher Dr. Benjamin Graffam, has taught my class many different
philosophical point of views of philosophers and has encouraged us to
engage in philosophy, to think outside of the topics of the class.
The negative opposite case would seem to be where a teacher would
teach philosophy, stating different philosophers’ point of views,
presenting different texts and analyzing them as if it were an
english class; the teacher had clearly taught the students much
information but they may not be as enlightened as they had not
engaged in the deep thought that is doing philosophy.</p>
<p class="western" align="left">I think that Plato’s AotC and
Godwin’s educational philosophy would agree in
educating/enlightening those who have not already. One conclusion
that I came to about the AotC is that it seems that Plato is stating
that it is the job of the enlightened to become the enlightening
force to others, as if putting the flame of a lighter to the wick of
one’s mind and hoping that it will catch as to keep burning.
Godwin’s ideas present an idea for a somewhat systematic path to
enlightenment, starting at an early age.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%">After
becoming familiar with these two topics, I sort of feel obligated to
teach people <font face="Avenir Next">to do philosophy. What I have
found in some attempts, is that some people have rejected this higher
order of thinking, claiming that it is “too much to think about,”
and “it hurts [their] brain”. Which suggested to me that perhaps
they just were not ready, but now, writing this, I realize that I
simply was just presenting some topics to them where my philosophy
class had already had some experience in philosophy, but these people
have not. I think that if I am to try again, I would have to go about
on a small/basic topic which should not be too had to reason about,
</font><font face="Avenir Next">rather than presenting to them the
entire complicated idea.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Next">Though,
there is also the element of what I will call “personal
acceptance,” of which someone must be able to accept an idea
without any side effects/moral conflicts; I do not want to put a
person in a position of which they may question the world in the
flavor of existential crisis of one’s existence in the world. I
personally have accepted the different theories and ideas from our
past few months of philosophy class into my own mind’s space as I
expected philosophy class to present all of these ideas. But for
others, many are not prepared and require some time to prepare
themselves, though I know that Dr. Graffam mentioned at the beginning
of this school year while we were having a class discussion about
some sensitive topic, that it is good that we are presented with some
potentially difficult questions at our age, as though we do not have
to answer them now, taking them in and letting it boil in the mind’s
stove will prepare ourselves to answer them in the future.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" align="left">I hope that my ideas and words of
advice have reached across to my friend. I think it would also build
to her personal self-esteem, and confidence in herself as a student.
I may continue to write some updates on my friend’s situation in
the coming weeks, and will continue to censor their name from here.</p>
