I have been reflecting on one of my previous writings here,
essentially the big rant document from over the winter break, and how
I said that our ethics would revolve around the idea of survival of
the fittest. One question I have for myself is “To what degree
would we apply the idea of survival of the fittest?” One would that
that we would simply dominate over other humans, but I feel that one
aspect that someone would forget about is how someone would seek to
better the world for their children; that they would want their
offspring to continue on and perhaps have an easier time doing so.
There is the idea of sustainability, of which we would want to
improve a system as to make the system’s continued existence much
more likely, as how we want to improve the climate change crisis as
to improve world climate conditions for our descendants. Basically, I
think that considering we would like sustainability, I think that we
would logically value our sustainability over any short term policies
that would improve our current dominance.</p>

that I would list, in ranks of importance of value.</p>
<ol>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Sustainability of
	the population</p>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Survival of the
