<font face="Avenir Next">If everything has a causal relationship,
then by definition, everything is determined by other factors. If
humans are simply processing all things that are inputting into their
minds, then are all doing things as they are determined by all of the
input, and therefore would be determined and would not have free
will. Iâ€™m sort of revisiting some of my thoughts on free will and
determinism from our early days in philosophy, and its interesting to
rethink some of the conclusions I had back then. There are so many
arguments that could be made on the topic.</font></p>

<font face="Avenir Next">I eventually came to the conclusion that we
do not have free will, and that we are fully determined by things
which have occurred in the past, coming from two trains of thought,
one of quantum mechanics and physical science, and the second of
consideration of some characteristics of the human mind.</font></p>
