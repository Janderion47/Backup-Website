Father?</font></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
I once watched a television episode which featured a scene where a
man was going to leave his wife and daughter to protest/fight to
promote for the increasing of government measures to combat climate
change. The man said that he would not return until he had ensured
that the world will be set on a track of improving the conditions, he
wanted  his daughter to be able to live in a world where she does not
have to worry about the climate of the world which I believe is a
noble cause. What I want to question is if this noble cause outweighs
the daughter’s need for her father?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
The man, actually I do not want to keep saying that, lets call him
Joe; Joe certainly values his daughter as I specifically remember
that he wants her future to be as best as it can, but it seems that
he ignores her need for a father in her life, sort of valuing her
average comfort in life over her average comfort in life in the
shorter term, which if this is a math equation in the form of ‘a’
is greater than ‘b’, then I would agree in Joe’s decision to
maximize the value of ‘a’. I can understand this as parents want
the best for their childre; its like self sacrifice, I am sure that
there have been numerous scenarios depicted in movies and t.v. series
that show a parent sacrifising their own life for the survival of
their children; Joe, in not participating in his daugther’s
childhood, is practically dead in her life.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
Is Joe a good father in this case? Well, does valuing his daughter’s
future outweigh her need for a father in her life? We’re gonna need
a definition for “a good father” if we’re going to attack this
quesiton, as I have listened to a podcast where a group of friends
were playing the tabletop game Dungeons &amp; Dragons, which is a
roleplay, improv game in which multiple people (known as the players)
roleplay specific characters (known as playable characters or PCs)
and one of the members of the game controls the setting and plot of
the story of the game as it goes on (known as the Dungeon Master or
DM), the DM also roleplays non-playable character (NPCs). One of the
recent episodes sees one of the PCs put on trial on accusations of
being a bad father, which creates much interesting and funny
discourse as the other PCs taking on the defense of their accused
friend, and a guest player roleplays the offending lawyer. In
roleplaying this court of law, the defending lawyers, began an
attempt to use philosophical thinking in creating a defense for their
friend, saying that, they acknowledge some of the legitimate claimes
of bad parenting from their friend, the defendant’s intentions in
trying to be a single father are good, and that the court of law
cannot put him in jail for having good intentions but bad execution.
The offending lawyer stated that it does not matter what the morals
say, what matters within their court of law is the word of the law
itself, questioning “by our law, has your friend broken our law?”.
By this time, the players and DM had paused for a moment in their
playing to acknowledge that the DM did not foresee the usage of
morality, and that he was sorry for not specifying how the accused’s
“goodness” would be judged. In the end, the accused was found
guilty of being a bad dad, and the players found that it would be a
magical embodiment of the law of the land that would eventually hand
out the punishment to the character.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
This episode of the podcast always brings me back to the fact that it
is difficult to objectively determine what consitutes as being a good
parent, as the “objective” perspective of the law in that podcast
did not take into account the situationalness of events and
incidents. Though, I think it would not be hard to consider what
would consitute a good parent in terms of necessary and sufficient
conditions; I think it would be harder to determine sufficient
conditions for being a good parent than determining necessary
conditions for the same as that suggest that there must be one
singular trait of a person that would label them as a good parent.
Even if we were to construct a list of necessary and sufficient
conditions, I doubt that all people who might be considered good
parents would be in accordance with all of the necessary conditions.
Would we even be able to answer the question “Is Joe a good father
in his decision to leave his family for the benefit of his daughter?”
if there is no objective “good father” or “good parent”? If
we cannot, then what is the significance of the fact that we have no
objective definition for either?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
I do not think that we would be able to answer the question as having
an understanding of what a good father is necessary before we can
compare Joe to the criteria. The fact that we have no objective
definition shows that perhaps the concept of a good father is very
much subjective, everyone can have their own opinion, but there must
be a singlular definition, there must be.</p>

<font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Good
and Evil</font></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
Thinking about this previous topic reminds me of one other topic
discussing the idea of good. I remember the following ethical issue
from the Marvel movie “Doctor Strange”, of which one of the
central characters of the story had been revealed to use a form of
magic considered to be evil, to power their good intentions toward
the world. This was revealed when this central character had to face
off with some actual forces of evil, who were also using the evil
form of magic. Now, I was about to argue that, perhaps its not the
magic that is evil, it is simply the people who use it are usually
evil, considering that this central character is using it with good
intentions, but for context, this magic comes from the literal enemy
of the central character, which makes the central character a
hypocrite as was called out by the one central evil character.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
I will agree that this usage of the by-definition, evil magic by the
central character makes her a hypocrate, as her entire school of
magic was establish to protect the world from outside forces such as
the one which the evil magic comes from, but does that make her a
bad/evil person? That again needs a solid, objective definition of
good apart from evil.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
I think that it is also important to understand the diction of some
of this idea that this central person is a hypocrite for posing as a
good character yet using the weapons of evil depend on the idea that
the use of said evil weapons is a necessary condition for being
considered as evil. But if this previous idea is states that users
are evil because they use evil weapons, the central character would
then be evil by definition, yet is clearly not evil as seen in the
movie. Now, there were actual “evil” characters in the movie, who
were greatly opposed to the central character and the protagonist.
The lead “evil” character critiqued the central character at the
beginning of the movie, in a fight scene, where the central character
had fought off many of the “evil” characters, whilst using the
weapon of evil. The lead “evil” character called the central
character a hypocrite as the central character had pledged to protect
the earth from the great source of evil of which the weapon of evil.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
If one can use of an instrument of evil, of which gives the user the
status as being evil, but does not make this user evil, is it evil? I
do not think that the instrument is evil then. Actually, (drawing
away from the previously mentioned movie,) when I think of many
systems of magic in many films, videogames and the such, there is not
usually a solid definition of good or evil centered into the systems
of magic themselves, more onto the socio-political structure of the
society, and governments. For example, there may be a group of people
who have excellent command over fire, and have fire related powers;
this group might perform many political actions which would lead the
group to be percieved as beign barbarian, a sort of evil, which this
status may spread to the command of fire itself. But we, who look
upon the political state of this fictional world can see that there
is no innate “evilness” to the use of this fire. Another group
may also command fire, but would be like switzerland, in being
politically neutral and peaceful, they might be critiqued for their
status as a neutral group and the ability to command fire, but
nevertheless they are not evil; being able to command fire is not a
necessary condition for being evil.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
So if the weapons/tools/instruments of people do not define a
person’s or a group’s status as a being good or evil, then what
is able to determine status as good or evil? Well, lets think about
political motivations. The Cold War featured the opposition of the
two greatest powers of the world. Both sides deemed the other to be
bad, while themselves are good. The American side claimed capitalism
to be better than communism and the Soviet Union claimed that
communism is better. But how can, for example, capitalism be both
good and bad in comparison to communism? This is only a contradiction
if status as being both good and evil is a sufficient condition for
being a problem. But is it a problem? Well the United States’
appraisal of capitalism being valued higher than communism is
motivation for actual violence as seen in history, with the USSR’s
appraisal of communism is valued higher than capitalism does the
same, perhaps a rephrasing of the two points of views in terms of
higher or lower status would be much more clearer than simply stating
that one is good and one is evil, but this assumes that in all cases,
the status of good versus evil is dependent on two items being valued
against each other and the one with the highest value being good, and
the second would be bad. Considering this, it seems that there are
two different comparisons here, good and evil as complete polar
opposites, and things that are similar to a degree of which they must
be compared. The former seems to be a scale of which one is either,
nothing in the middle, but on one of the ends; while the latter is
certainly a scale of which can lie anywhere between the two ends. The
former suggests that things are either purely good or evil, the
latter permits people to be some mix of the characteristics of a good
or evil person. Both cases suggest that there is some sort of pure
standard for both good and evil, though I do not think that it would
be easy to judge an entitiy’s status as being good or evil if the
only options are either pure good or pure evil; the entity that will
be judged will be weighed against the standards.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
I realize now that the main question that I would like to find and
answer to is “Is there truly a philosophical good and evil?” I do
not think that there would be any illogic in creating a standard of
good and evil, the standard would be an example of how one should
live what being a good or bad person is, what they do, but the basis
of which we create this would then be asking a different question of
how one should live.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
About when we studied Aristotle’s four causes, I gave some thought
to how we might develop our ethics, how it means to be a good person
and what it means to be a bad person. But I considered that there are
no innate things in the universe, as Aristotle imagined in the use of
his four causes. This is something that I have considered for a long
time, how we build our ethics using our knowledge of philosophy and
logical thinking. I once came to the conclusion that there is no
innate meaning to anything in existence and that all meaning and
definitions have been artificially created by our human minds
attempting to comprehend our own existence. If there is no innateness
in the world, and all concepts are artificial, I believe that we will
have to pick one statement or idea to be the central point of which
all other decisions and ethics will be built from. I think that most
societies in human history have used this previous structure of
taking one idea as the central point for all of one’s thinking; for
example, judaism/christianity/islam which has established the word of
God as the focal point of their ethics and decisions, as God’s word
has established what is good (at least in jews and christians, I am
not too familiar with the faith of muslims); god, who is supreme over
all, has determined what is good and evil.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
Good has always seemed to be in reference to things of the world that
follow a sort of , natural order, or “the natural order”, while
evil/ bad does the opposite, and goes against the flow of the natural
order. If we set this idea as our central point of which to build our
ethics, then it suggests that all people that follow the natural
order are good people. It begs to ask “What is the natural order of
the world?” and when I considered this, I was reminded the quote
that “the natural order of the universe is disorder,” of which I
do not recall where I have heard that quote, but it is something that
I have accepted to be true as it seems that the universe, with all of
our knowledge of planets, stars, interstellar bodies, the seemingly
mathmatical randomness of all of it on both the macroscopic scales,
including those spacial bodies, and the microscopic, at molecules and
other happenings at the quantum scale. But it seems that this
disorder does not exactly apply to life here on earth, with
non-sentient life being faced with the harshness of survival of the
fittest.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
Considering that all life has evolved to be the best that it can as
to survive in the harsh world, I ask why did we humans develop
sentience, our recognition of the self, and the ability to think, to
become metacognitive of our own thinking, and actions? I say that we
developed sentience as it increased our likelihood of survival in the
world in this system of survival of the fittest and evolution by
creating civilization and creating a barrier between the animal and
human worlds. Though, are we breaking the “natural order” by
excluding ourselves from the non-sentient survival of the fittest? I
was about to write that we are, but then I considered that the
creation of the barrier between the animal and human worlds is a part
of the natural order as it is humans use of our sentience and
intelligence that has led us to increase our survivability in this
world and would be considered as good as we are following the natural
order.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
I think that this consideration of our world’s structure of
survival of the fittest would lead to humans systematically
establishing status over all other lifeforms using our high
intellect, perhaps though a systematic killing of some sort but I now
would not like to think of what people would do, following the
“natural order” of evolving to better oneself and survival of the
fittest, though I think this previous idea of total domination of the
world would be edited a little bit by doing anything with our
intellect to increase our degree of comfort. This reminds me of some
lore from Star Wars, which told of an alien race which fully embraced
the natural order of survival of the fittest and evolving to become
better, as they became prolific warriors and amassed great armies to
fight other civilizations and even each other, all in the obedience
to the “natural order”.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
How are we to treat other people if we would use our intellect to
benefit us in survival of the fittest? Well, we could surely
strategize, to figure out the best way to interact with others as to
benefit ourselves, which in our current society would make one look
like a self-centered character. I think strategizing would be the
best option; as for specifics, I think that would be very
situational, based on who you are interacting with, other people’s
traits, reasoning for either keeping or not keeping close to said
people. This feels comparable to William Godwin’s thoughts on all
people thinking for themselves, and for all people to decide for
themselves what is the philosophically good thing to do. The use of
our intellect in this set of ethics would simply be to better
ourselves, whether physically or intellectually, I’m not so sure.
Survival of the fittests states that organisms with the better traits
would have a high survivability; I think that a necessary condition
of a trait being favored is if the trait increases the survivability
of the organism, yet that does not answer the question of phyisical
or intellectual traits being more or less favored than the other.
Both physical and intellectual traits are affected by both our
genetics and experiences of the real world, as you could go to a gym
and exercise as to better yourself physically, and you could study
and engage in thought on things of science and philosophy.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
I think that is something that is very important as human beings, as
our ability to recognize our own existence and our own traits has led
us to be able to train ourselves as to improve ourselves. I cannot
think of any other species that is able to recognize their own self,
and acknowledge their own traits. Thats something that we have, the
ability to recognize ourself and others which is very important to
our existence as a human being.</p>
