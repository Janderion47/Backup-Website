<font face="Avenir Next">It is the morning, I’m sitting in the
patio; first temperature read this morning said it was fifty degrees
celsius, with a high of fifty-nine degrees celsius. </font><font face="Avenir Next">My
feet are cold, and I’m wearing socks and slippers right now. But at
least I have the ‘Breadstick”. Oh, and on that note,</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 0.5in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
<font face="Avenir Next">So I finally opened the ‘Breadstick’ on
Thursday the seventh, and I had to put the bridge up and tune the
strings, which I found wasn’t too hard, until I had to do the high
‘e’ string, which posed an issue. The other three strings were
affixed to the tailpiece of the Breadstick in a loop, while the ‘e’
string was not, the end of the string was knotted in such a manner
that it was sufficiently fat enough to hold it’s place on the tail
piece. I believed this fixture to be sufficiently strong enough, but
while I was attempting to tune the string, the balled end of the
string popped off. I then messaged the luthier in a sort of panicked
</font><font face="Avenir Next">state of anxiety, telling them about
the state of the instrument and how I might fix it. We eventually
concluded that rather than balling the end again, I should tie/loop
it as the other three strings are. This proved to work good, as the
‘e’ string held while I </font><font face="Avenir Next">tuned it,
but I have found that the there isn't sufficient amount of friction
between the ‘e’ string tuning peg and peg box to hold it at
proper tuning, so I have decided to tune the instrument to A4=415hz,
also known as baroque pitch.</font></p>

<font face="Avenir Next">I’</font><font face="Avenir Next">ve
bought a </font><font face="Avenir Next">fiberglass bow from the
Winter Haven Carlton Music in downtown, which was the cheapest option
at around forty-five dollars, while the wood bows are around ninety
to ninety-nine dollars, and some special color laced carbon-fiber
bows at around one-hundred-forty dollars. I also got some rosin, of
which funny enough, the strings guy, Michael, suggested some
different kinds of rosin to me, also stating that “it really
depends on your amount of experience,” of which I told him that I
have absolutely no experience with the violin, of which he then
</font><font face="Avenir Next">paused for a moment, and then replied
“Yeah, I’ll give you this one,” which I think was one of the
funniest things of my day.</font></p>
