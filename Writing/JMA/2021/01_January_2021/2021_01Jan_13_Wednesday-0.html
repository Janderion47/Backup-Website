Part 1:</h1>
<p class="western">I am currently listening to the forty-ninth
episode of the podcast “Dungeons &amp; Daddies” and let’s just
say that I have been waiting for their first episode of 2021, very
eagerly. So far, I am about twenty-eight minutes in and, it is within
my expectations let’s just say.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
<font face="Avenir Next">It is interesting to me how role play games
make people face moral decisions. For those who do not know, in
Dungeons and Dragons (DnD), the games are controlled by what is
essentially the narrator, known as the Dungeon Master (DM), and
basically, they have full control of the plot, the setting, and just
generally can do whatever with the story as they see fit. The DM of
Dungeons &amp; Daddies, which I will now refer to as ‘DnDad’, is
a guy named Anthony Burch, and one of the biggest plot points that he
has placed in the story so far is [, without any context as to not
spoil the story], when essentially everyone in the game had to decide
if whether one of the playable characters (PC) is a good father to
his son. After much deliberation, it was decided that the specific PC
was a good person, but performed poorly as a father, and was
therefore a bad father.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
<font face="Avenir Next">It is this situation which has led me to
question if role play like this is an effective tool for teaching
morality and letting people make decisions that would affect only
people who were fake. Just like reading a book, more specifically, a
novel of which we are able to follow some characters and we most
likely become attached to some of them, especially if we are able to
really see into their mind and how they think; it is that which I
believe we are able to relate to characters as we may be able to
compare ourselves to them and also critique their actions and
thoughts. Doing this, we can learn some lessons that we possible
would not be able to as perhaps the situations that we are seeing
would be questionable or just generally bad if they were to happen in
real life. In role-play, the role players are able to take on the
personas of characters who likely differ from themselves </font><font face="Avenir Next">and
infer on what that character, with all of the knowledge of the
character, with all of the assumptions that have been made about
their actions and mannerisms, make decisions based off of the
characters’ that they are playing. It is a good story such as that
of DnDad which lets we, the audience, to also do the same, we can
relate to the characters, and critique their actions, we then feel a
great, somewhat personal connection to one of the characters.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
<font face="Avenir Next">For example, oh and spoiler warning for the
rest of this document [I recommend that only if you have listened to
the entirety of DnDad up to episode forty-nine that you continue
reading this; unless you are the kind of person to not mind spoilers,
cheers to you, continue on], the PC that was found to be a bad
father, was the character Glenn Close, who was known to being a
rockstar guitarist, being an open consumer of marijuana, and single
father, which that latter has passed to his son, Nicholas “Nick”
Close. When Glenn was made the defendant of a court case against him,
with the charge of being a bad father [which apparently is considered
against the law, but with more context one would be able to
understand what was happening in the story]. The three other PCs,
Henry Oak, Ron Stampler, Darryl Wilson, were essentially three
lawyers with the goal of convincing the twelve real-life people who
were role playing as jurors outside of the normal conversation of the
podcast that Glenn was not a bad father, of which they had used many
arguments based </font><font face="Avenir Next">on the PCs’
knowledge of their relationships with Glenn, and the PCs’ personal
view of Glenn as a person. I think in particularly, Beth May, who
plays Ron Stampler, did very well in her characterization of Ron
during the court case as it seems that he sits somewhere near the
milder end of the autism spectrum, but May’s interpretation of
Ron’s appraisal of the situation and May’s choice of words for
Ron fits very well into what we expect of the character: a little bit
insensitive, not so much as in a disrespectful kind of way, but
perhaps as more as not understanding that he should be watering down
the truthful description of Glenn as a person, when the others would
most likely understate any of the bad things that Glenn has done.</font></p>

<p class="western" align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
<font face="Avenir Next">As a listener to the excellent podcast that
is DnDad, I was obviously somewhat aggravated when the team at DnDad
left us all on a cliff-hanger at the end of 2020. Its was as if I was
reading a book and someone snatched the book from my grasp whilst
turning the page from the climax to the falling action, and being
angry that they would keep the story from me. Writing this, I hear
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6xEHCWUvalb0fNYuAo591v?si=pipwYIhhTjuxwDPa-jhC9g">this
excellent song</a> from <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2YhXnAimoKot4C5ZU1Enaa?si=ANTtIEdYSxCdkvOGA_AE9A">my
first quarter of 2021 playlist</a>; I think that that song would be a
good sonic-metaphor for the chaos that is my mind right now
considering what has occurred in episode forty-nine of DnDad. </font><font face="Avenir Next">I
feel that it would be relevant to bring up something I remember from
my research on William Godwin; Godwin, </font><font face="Avenir Next">in
essay five of part one of his book</font><font face="Avenir Next">
“The Enquirer”, </font><font face="Avenir Next">while talking
about developing a liking of reading early in children, mentions that
“The late reader makes a superficial acquaintance with his author,
but is never admitted into the familiarity of a friend.” which
would suggest that those do have an early liking of reading, do have
a great intimate connection to the author and perhaps the product of
the author. The sentences following that quote actually support that
last point, “...the familiarity of a friend. Stiffness and
formality are always visible between them. He does not become the
creature of his author; neither bends with all his caprices, nor the
sympathies with all his sensations.” Perhaps for books this is
true, but I think otherwise for this improvisational work done by
role players; like it feels to be listened to as if it were some
piece of text, but then we remember that the story is entirely
improvisational of some people, </font><font face="Avenir Next">some
people who are people in the real world just like us, some people</font><font face="Avenir Next">
who have full control of the characters of the story. </font><font face="Avenir Next">With
this we are able to juxtapose ourselves to the characters of the
story, </font><font face="Avenir Next">especially if the dictation
and characterization of the characters is done very well. One
statement that I have heard from someone who is involved with theater
and theatrical performances is that the person playing the role must
be able to lock in with the persona of the character to be able to do
it well, which I think that the team at DnDad are doing well.</font></p>
<h1 class="western">Part 2:</h1>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
<font face="Avenir Next">Stories are just recollections of events
which are conveyed in a variety of ways, whether by hear-say, written
as a book or series of texts, as a movie or series of videos
televised or streamed on the internet today. I wanted to connect the
stories told in books to those told in television shows, but I was
having a hard time thinking of how this might be. I now remember how
many Spanish speaking countries refer to their televised serial shows
as “Telenovelas” which essentially means “televised novels”
which I think places highlight on the differences between people
acting out a story’s plot in a recorded video as the characters of
the story would, versus how books or texts simply describe to us how
the actions occur, and how the characters move about. Now, I can
understand how Godwin would say that books require a supporting love
for reading to fully process the information in a book as it would be
simple to watch a person do something versus the somewhat more
difficult task of understanding someone’s verbal/written
description of what has occurred [yes, I know that Godwin being of
the late eighteenth century did not have television, but he did have
plays, which I would say fits the same position of people acting out
characters]. </font><font face="Avenir Next">For me, this still
doesn’t explain why I feel such a great connection to the DnDad
podcast.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
<font face="Avenir Next">I have been approaching this topic under the
impression that Godwin’s idea of not being fully embraced into the
written story as a result of not having an early love for reading was
not compatible with the video or visual novel, but perhaps I was too
quick to accept that idea. I know that from a young age that I have
been interested in televised shows, namely the filipino shows that my
family has watched in the many years prior before we had our cable
t.v. removed about a year ago. I know that I have been able to enjoy
and understand the shows with translation from family members and
later, english captions. [Side note, sorry, but another good song is
playing and I just want to preserve it <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0jt2KjzQH7GQwHOrWKNniP?si=HzPsY01ETiywPYZvrBOiJg">here</a>.]</font></p>
