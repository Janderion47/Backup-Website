I haven’t really had the chance to write it down until now, but
last Sunday, in the afternoon, my family and I went to Lake Kissimmee
State Park. Its not the most eventful place, but I will say that it
is very calm there. We’ve seen many animals, notably some deer and
an armadillo.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">There is something
really nice about the quietness of the park there, its a great place
to be alone as you could simply park out in their camp ground and
just be alone. I think it would be a great place to bring out some
friends, talk, engage with each other as you’d be forced to do so,
as the cellular signal over there is very rubbish. I mentioned it in
english this morning when my english teacher, Mr. Johnston, asked me
how my weekend was; he mentioned that Lake Kissimmee is one of the
places in Florida in which you can see the milky way, which is
something that I will do in the future.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">This reminds me of that
one book we read in the beginning of English this school year, “Into
the Wild” which most heavily focused on embracing nature and begin
a part of it all, and feeling it out. With that in mind, it feels to
be a great place to relax and chill and center one’s self.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">When I get the chance
to, when I’m older and I can be alone by myself wit h my parents’
permission, I think I’d like to spend a day alone at the park.
Perhaps on another day, I would go with some friends, and we could
just chill all together. I think I’ll add this to my bucket list
with my friends.</p>
