There is something interesting that I would like to discuss, which is our human development. My IB Global Politics Teacher, Mr. Scribner, took a few weeks to discuss one model of societal development which comes from Clare Graves, of which societies generally move from pure instinct and the need to survive, all the way to a communistic mindset of which we value all life and our place in the world as to care for all life, and even to some theorized higher levels of societal development which greatly confuse me as even the author recognized that the speculative ideas are confusing. This eight-level model of development suggests that societies would generally move away from the belief in some form of supernatural power which determines what is “good” and “bad”, to an empirically thinking, rational mindset which would engage in high thinking and critique all things.
I am most interested in religion, of which I have been in critique of in recent months. I agree with this model of societal development because I think that it is natural for us to critique previous societal systems, and perhaps change those systems to how we see fit. According to Graves, the second of the eight levels of development would see the development of a belief in a sort of magical system of which I will just refer to as religion. The fifth level would see rational thinking in the society. I think that our current society here in the United States is sitting at around the fourth level’s righteous order of unvarying “right” and “wrong”; the fifth level’s rational thinking as in people can critique the current systems; and also the sixth level’s ecological sensitivity toward the world, though, that aspect may not be compatible with some American individualism.
I think that our historical societies created religious belief as to explain why the world is the way it is, as in, the statement that practically every society had a creation story; almost every people had developed a system of belief that derives from a “natural order” of the world. These systems of belief likely were very basic as those who created them did not have the complex thinking and comprehension skills that we have today. Today, we have the ability of thought as to critique all things, decide what we would like to do based on our decision of what we should be doing, and it would be natural to critique the previous religious systems. We had religious faith to explain our world, but now we have the capabilities to explain it ourselves.
Another thought that has come to mind is how computer programmers and scientists are attempting to create artificial intelligence. One of the motivations to do so, I assume, is to understand our own minds and how they work, and I can only assume that they hope to make these artificial intelligences on equal with us beings. Because that is the goal right? To create other beings as to fully complete our understanding of how ourselves as beings are in existence? We are attempting to recreate ourselves under the assumption that our creation will be a good resemblance of ourselves, and some are attempting to directly recreate our own brains in computers.
It is that which is interesting to me, much of our motivation for innovating our society is to understand our place in the universe, and to also keep our place in the universe; because on the other hand, we also want to survive in our small fraction of the universe. We ask questions like “are we alone in the universe?”, “If there are aliens, what will their morals be like?”, et cetera. We also are working to keep ourselves alive, by making plans to leave earth as to sustain us.
