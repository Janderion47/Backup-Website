I have recently had a very minor dispute with between my friend
Jessica, with observers, such as Jacob Mitchell and another friend
whose name I do not recall right now. Jessica and I could not agree
as to which I fractured my ankle some years ago. I claimed that I
know that I hurt myself in February of 2018 as I recall lying on the
couch for a weekend as I watched the opening of the 2018 winter
olympics, whereas Jessica disagreed, saying that she knows that she
was also hurt at one time when I was hurt. Jacob made a humorous
remark as to perhaps both Jessica and I are both wrong. I
acknowledged Jacobâ€™s statement, saying that that is possible as the
opposing statements cannot both be correct, but could be both wrong
as there could potentially be some case that any of us have not
considered at the moment. Jessica and I have sought out some grounds
to cement our claims of knowledge into; Jessica, searching for some
photos which would show that she was hurt when I was hurt, and
myself, searching for confirmation from former and current classmates
of mine who were with me when I was hurt. I eventually found the dvd
which I received from the doctors office that contains a record of
the x-rays that <font face="Avenir Next">were taken of my injury</font>,
and also the time of which they were taken, which shows that I was
hurt during the time that I claimed to know.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Avenir Next">I understand why Jacob did not immediately
accept or dismiss either of the claims presented, there simply was
not enough information to support either, and so he offered the
somewhat rare, third option. I think he was right to dismiss the
claims as both were only supported by human recollection, which I
supposed he weighted against each other and found that neither was
any more than the other. One of the things that I mentioned to my
friends here while we were discussing this is that we should be open
to the fact that any one of these arguments could be the correct one
with the information that we had on hand, and that we should be open
to finding information for all of them, rather than just supporting
our own argument, I might be pulling it out of our discussions of
ethics, but I think we should also be non-biased when searching for
information on a topic.</font></p>
