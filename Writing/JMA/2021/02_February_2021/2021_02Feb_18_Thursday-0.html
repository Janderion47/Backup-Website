<font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">I have had the opportunity
recently to put into place some of the ideas of our dealings with the
treatment of wrongdoing here in philosophy. I have been leading a
Dungeons &amp; Dragons game for the past few weeks, and it has
recently became important that I establish the justice system of the
fictional setting of our game. Considering the cultural context of
the world, I decided that the justice system would be structured
around the idea of rehabilitating the minds of criminals as it seems
appropriate to implement in the society.</font> <font face="Avenir Next"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">The
important question in doing this task is how should approach the
creation of a rehabilitating system that respects people’s status
as rational beings and respects peoples personal autonomy, which the
latter is a concern of Kant on retributive.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Avenir Next"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">Actually,
I want to approach this critique of retribution's push to change the
minds of people. I will say, if attempting to convince someone that
their current form of thinking is an infringement of a person’s
personal autonomy, then attempting to convince a person to change
their mind of anything is an infringement, which completely
disassembles our ideas of how we should be open to other ideas and
arguments made by other people. How can we have any discussions if
any attempt to convince a person of something is wrong? I argue that
a sufficient condition of an action being an infringement on a
person’s personal autonomy is if the action was forcing upon this
individual something that is actually going against their will
because it would seem correct to equate one’s personal autonomy
with their will over themselves.</font></font></p>

<font face="Avenir Next"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">I
made a joke to my friend Jessica, who is one of the players in my D&amp;D
game, that there was a ten step program for the rehabilitation of
criminals in the setting’s justice system. I then decided from that
one small piece of information that I would create this plan. Going
back to the question that I asked earlier here, I think that to
create this system that would rehabilitate people whilst also
respecting their status as rational beings and their autonomy would
be to make it as if we were trying to convince someone of something;
and since we are engaged here in logical thinking, I think the best
way to do this would be to basically show them the structure of our
logic and argument that what they have done is wrong, hoping that
they will agree with our argument, or if not, that they would provide
reasoning as to why they disagree as to our argument. This reflects
our basic way of presenting arguments to other people, that we
present the argument, and the other party will have the chance to
support or refute the argument, and in all cases, we can always
provide supplementary arguments. After this deliberation, we should
then present again, perhaps the errors in their logic, and how to
correct those errors, which essentially is teaching them how to be
better people.</font></font></p>

<font face="Avenir Next"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">Considering
the video that was presented to us in philosophy on Wednesday, the
seventeenth of this month, I also wanted to include in this plan, an
opportunity for prisoners within the fictional world to have
something that they can do once out of the custody of the law: the
criminals will then be assisted in finding a place of work or other
action as to not commit any more crimes in the future. The fictional
government of which is implementing this program does have the
financial power to help all of these people in this way. </font></font>
