I always watch some of the older YouTube videos created by bassist
Adam Neely every now and then. One of these videos come from before
the pandemic, where he was at a gig, where one of his fellow
musicians had given him a brownie that had some marijuana in it. The
entire video essentially had the advice of “play sober, unless
playing whilst intoxicated is intentional.” as he had a great
difficulty playing bass at his 100% in that gig. I’m sure Mr. Neely
has always known that playing intoxicated would be a detriment, but
having the experience of having a hard time perform whilst
intoxicated would really solidify that piece of knowledge. I think
the relationship between knowledge and the knower here is that the
knower can know something as perhaps they were told the information
by someone else, but they wouldn’t listen to this knowledge as much
in comparison to if they have a first hand account of the same
knowledge. This suggests that we have a difference in the
consideration of knowledge based on where we received them, which
should not be the case since knowledge is knowledge.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">If we consider the
knowledge of jumping from a high place will hurt you, I’m sure
there are some people that would take this claim of knowledge and
challenge it; for example, some young children might be expected to
climb a tree, jump, and hurt themselves. I do not think that they
would do it again after that. I think this demonstrates a good
working of thinking of a claim of knowledge on behalf of the child
that has hurt their self by jumping from the tree, they have been
told a claim of knowledge, but they are still unsure of supporting
grounds for the claim; the knowledge that they got hurt would confirm
their doubts about the claim that jumping from high places will hurt
you.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">But that is of a
child, who probably doesn’t have much knowledge of the world yet.
For us who are already very knowledgeable, assuming that for some
reason we have not already known that jumping from a high place will
hurt us, we would approach the claim that ‘jumping from a high
place will hurt us’ using logic, rather than immediately physically
challenging the claim. We could reason that our bones are not strong
enough to take the impact, or correlate how objects break on impact;
and then perhaps there is enough evidence there to support the claim,
and we would not try it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I do not think that
I commonly do things against the word of others, but if I am given
the opportunity to do so in the future, I think I’ll think about it
hard before even considering whether I should or need to.</p>
