<font face="Avenir Next">S</font>hould we <font face="Avenir Next">treat
a</font> sibling differently to comparison to an acquaintance? <font face="Avenir Next">For
simplicity, lets say </font><font face="Avenir Next">that this
acquaintance is certainly a person that you know </font><font face="Avenir Next">but
not necessarily are very close to, or you simply know as just a
peer/college.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Avenir Next">I think that we should treat bout our
siblings and our acquaintances the same, </font><font face="Avenir Next">because
I think as a baseline, we should not treat anyone with negativity,
and attempt to be as positive and appropriate as possible </font><font face="Avenir Next">to
all people, which I suppose would be a </font><font face="Avenir Next">categorical
imperative; </font><font face="Avenir Next">it would be morally wrong
to be openly angry toward a person where it is not appropriate</font><font face="Avenir Next">.
I would attempt to treat any person in this manner, as I would
approve of the same manner from another person to myself. Considering
the benefits argument, being negative to </font><font face="Avenir Next">this</font><font face="Avenir Next">
person of which you are not very close to </font><font face="Avenir Next">would
not have any benefits and if anything, would be a detriment to the
relationship between yourself and the acquaintance.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Avenir Next">Should the fact that your sibling is more
than a person that you do not know affect your treatment of them? As
we have already established, I would treat them in as much positivity
as appropriately as possible, so could we be any more
positive/friendly? I do not think we can without discussing specific
actions toward people. Considering that there exists some groups of
siblings who do not have amazing relationships with each other, I
think that the fact that you are siblings to each other affects how
you should treat each other; I think whether you should treat a
person more than the minimum of the previous categorical imperative
is dependent on how much more than you are just acquaintances with
the other person.</font></p>

<font face="Avenir Next">I suppose that blood relation would not
necessitate/force any two people to be friends, it would then be that
the two people just so happen to be related by blood in this view I
suppose.</font></p>

<font face="Avenir Next">One thing that my philosophy teacher
suggested the other day, perhaps in a slightly humorous manner, was
that perhaps we could construct a large spreadsheet, of which I
assume that one axis are full of situations of which person ‘a’
has wronged yourself, while the other axis is the specification of
person ‘a’; this spreadsheet would suggest that there would be
differing treatments of wrongdoers depending on who is the wrongdoer.
Considering the requirement of consistency, I feel that it would be
morally wrong to not be consistent within the treatment of a person
based on who they are. Like, we would not change a criminal’s
punishment based on race.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Avenir Next">I do not think that we should change the way
we treat a person for their wrongdoings. Sure, we would make
exceptions for cases of which the decision to commit the wrongdoing
was outside of the power of person ‘a’, or if it is a child who
has yet to understand moral treatment of fellow people, but
otherwise, our treatment of others and their wrongdoings should be
consistent.</font></p>
