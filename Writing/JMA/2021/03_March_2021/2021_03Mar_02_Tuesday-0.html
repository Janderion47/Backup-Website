One of the most important problems that I have been considering is
how an artificial intelligence should consider what to do if faced
with a situation where the only options include some degree of death
of some people, for example, where the artificial intelligence has to
choose between crashing and killing an elderly person, or killing all
passengers a car, lets say, two parents and their two young children.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; background: transparent">
We could look at the sanctity of human life argument, which would
tell us to save as much life as we can, which would lead use to crash
into the single elderly person. Or the benefits argument, where
crashing into the elderly person would end their life, but the family
would keep theirs, whereas we could have the death of the family, and
the elderly person could keep theirs. We would want to have the
greatest net-benefits, and would argue that we should crash into the
elderly person. With these ideas in mind, we would conclude that the
AI should permit the death of the elderly person.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; background: transparent">
But consider, what if we are faced with the situation where we have
to choose between the death of one of two people where both of the
people are pretty similar?</p>
