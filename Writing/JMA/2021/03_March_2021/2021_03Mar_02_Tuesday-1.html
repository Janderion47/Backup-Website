Are assumptions beliefs or knowledge? Colloquially, when we make an
assumption, we make a guess based on the partial knowledge of a topic
that we do have; we are filling in a hole in our knowledge. We fill
in these holes so that we can use the knowledge to consider more
ideas that are built off of the knowledge that we filled in.
Assumptions are beliefs as they are claims of knowledge that we do
not have direct grounds to support, but we have
interpolated/extrapolated based on the information that we do have
about the topic.</p>

When I posed this original question to the ToK class last Monday, I
think I had ‘suppositions’ in mind, what I meant to ask was are
suppositions beliefs or knowledge? When I think of creating
suppositions, I think of the creation of hypothetical potential
situations. I do not think that they are beliefs as we are not making
claims of knowledge, but it cannot also be knowledge since we have
not made any claims of knowledge. Within the context of the
hypothetical situation, I think the suppositions would be knowledge
within the situation as we have constructed a situation where the
suppositions are true. What about the logic and conclusions that stem
from the given information in this hypothetical situation, are they
knowledge or belief? Given that we have not created any new
suppositions within this hypothetical situation, within the
hypothetical, I think that the logic and conclusions created are
knowledge as we have solid grounds inside of the hypothetical, but
outside of the hypothetical, they are simply claims of knowledge that
would be completely true if the suppositions were no longer
hypothetical but rather literal and true.</p>
