Traps Are Not Gay, an Argument.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0in; line-height: 200%; background: transparent">
By Anonymous</p>
<h1 class="western">Introduction</h1>
<p style="line-height: 200%">Are traps gay? This question has haunted
many a straight man when they find that they are attracted to, let’s
say, Blaire White. This question is asked for good reason. Typically,
with the way we have traditionally defined gender in our societies, a
man was one with a penis, and a woman was one with a vagina. As the
world advanced, though, our ideas of gender are opening up. No longer
do man and woman mean the same thing as male and female (the key
difference being between sex and gender), and in the same way, no
longer does the word homosexual solely deal with the sex of the two
(or more) parties involved. My purpose in writing this is to finally
dispel the myth that traps are gay by making multiple arguments to
cover all possible ways that traps could be considered gay.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="line-height: 200%">Section 1: What is a
Trap?</h1>
<p style="line-height: 200%">The urban dictionary defines a trap as,
“A crossdresser, usually a fictional character in an anime, who
dresses up in the opposite gender's clothing to trick people into
thinking that they're the opposite gender.” From this definition,
we can pull out the key information of crossdresser. Crossdressers,
for the uninitiated, are people who choose to wear the clothes of the
opposite gender. Many definitions of trap, including the one quoted
earlier, exclude transgender (trans) people from the definition of
“trap.” I believe this is a misstep and downplays the use of the
word to address trans people. If one peruses Reddit, and goes to a
place like r/traps, for example, there are no crossdressers to be
found. Instead, the majority of posts involve trans women. To exclude
trans people from the definition of trap denies the fact that the
term has become ubiquitous to address both crossdressers and trans
people.</p>
<p style="line-height: 200%">So, to provide a simplified definition
to the word’s actual use, a trap is a crossdresser or transgender
person (usually Male to Female).</p>
<h1 class="western" style="line-height: 200%">Section 2: The
Opposition’s Primary Argument</h1>
<p style="line-height: 200%">The primary objection to the phrase,
“traps aren’t gay,” is the biological fact that traps are, in
most cases, biologically male. They believe that because traps are
born male, having relations with one would be a necessarily gay act.
This is a valid point, as taking the ‘sex’ part of the word
homosexual would imply that to be homosexual one would need to have
relations with someone of the same sex. As stated earlier, I do not
believe the definition of homosexual in the modern era supports this.
As gender has become more open to interpretation, so has our
definition of homosexual. I believe the ‘sex’ part of homosexual
no longer refers to sex, but gender. For example, if a cis woman and
a trans woman had relations, it would be considered a lesbian
relationship as it is two women being together. Therefore, with the
modern definition of homosexual, a man having relations with a
Male-to-Female trap, the act would not be gay. However, this argument
only covers the trans part of the definition of trap, and not the
crossdresser part.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="line-height: 200%">Section 3: The Argument
for Femininity</h1>
<p style="line-height: 200%">The most powerful argument used in the
support of the statement, “traps aren’t gay,” is the statement
that femininity, not sex or gender, determine the homosexual nature
of an act, with femininity being the perceived gender of the trap. If
one perceives that another is a woman due to their feminine
appearance, and proceeds to perform an act on the other under that
notion, the act is not gay. This is because the person performing the
act is under the impression that they are performing a straight act,
therefore negating any way of the act being considered gay for the
one performing it. The trap itself could choose to say that it was a
gay relationship, but in this document I am only considering the
trapped, not the trap.</p>
<p style="line-height: 200%">The other argument that involves
femininity is that straight men are naturally attracted to
femininity, and therefore being attracted to something feminine is
not gay. While previous arguments discussed actually performing
sexual acts with, this deals more with the basic attraction, which is
the main area in which straight men question their sexuality. In my
mind, if what attracted the man was the femininity of the person, and
not any masculine traits, then the attraction is not gay. However,
this definition only applies to attraction, and could not protect a
man who continues to engage in relations with the trap after the
initial attraction/trap. That is governed, instead, by the feminine
penis argument.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="line-height: 200%">Section 4: The Feminine
Penis Argument</h1>
<p style="line-height: 200%">The feminine penis argument revolves
around the idea that someone’s sex organs do not necessarily need
to align with their gender; gender again being the defining factor in
homosexuality in the modern age. This argument also plays on the fact
that trans women experience feminization of the penis and scrotum
during transition, which is basically just the shrinking of the
scrotum and softening of the penis. This argument would state that
someone born male, who identifies as a woman, would have a feminine
penis. Even if the person is not transgender, the penis is still
feminine as the defining factor would be the gender, or perceived
gender, of the trap. Under previous arguments, it would only be gay
to have traditional relations with the trap, or to have the trap
perform something like a blowjob on you, but under this argument, all
actions regarding a trap’s penis enter the area of not being gay.
This includes things like giving a trap a blowjob and handling a
trap’s penis.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="line-height: 200%">Conclusion</h1>
<p style="line-height: 200%">In conclusion, based on arguments
involving linguistics, femininity, and feminine penises, traps are
not gay. This means that if you are a straight male who has
experienced sexual attraction to a trap, you are not gay. That is,
unless you define yourself as gay. Ultimately, the deciding factor as
to whether or not something is gay is the discretion of the
individual. Though I may not see traps as gay, it is perfectly okay
if you do, and in that way refuse to have a relationship with a trap.
Anyone who says that all straight people must be open to
relationships with traps are ill informed, and only seeking to be on
the progressive side of the social spectrum. It is the right of each
individual person to decide who they want to enter into a
relationship with, and if someone having a penis turns someone off,
then they should be allowed to deny a relationship with a trap.</p>
